\section{Conclusion}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item self-healing in \gls{kubernetes} is an architectural approach
    \item achieves fault-tolerance through replication and redundancy
    \item on failure: redundant components take over
    \item after failure: the system converges to the desired state by rescheduling pods (pod controller)
    \item this reflects the self-stabilizing aspect of self-healing systems
    \item pod priorities and pod disruption budges help on resource pressure and failure to keep essential services running (through terminating non-essential ones and restarting them when more resources get available) to allow survivability of the system
  \end{itemize}
