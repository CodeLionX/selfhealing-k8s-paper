\section{Conclusion}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item short summary (microservices, self-healing, how \gls{kubernetes} does it)
    \item self-healing in \gls{kubernetes} is an architectural approach
    \item achieves fault-tolerance through replication and redundancy
    \item on failure: redundant components take over
    \item after failure: the system converges to the desired state by rescheduling pods (pod controller)
    \item pod priorities and pod disruption budges help on resource pressure and failure to keep essential services running (through terminating non-essential ones and restarting them when more resources get available)
  \end{itemize}
