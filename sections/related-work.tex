\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related-work}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Is this chapter needed?} I could put a quick rundown of the approaches (\cite{ToffettiMicroservices,DashofyArchitecture,gru}) into \cref{sec:self-healing}
    \item Reactive Manifesto~\cite{reactivemanifesto} asks for more resilient and responsive systems.
      The resilience is achieved by replication, containment, isolation, and delegation.
      Recovery should be handled by an external component.
      This could be a self-healing component.
    \item \cite{StackCloud}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item hierarchical approach
        \item layered master-slave architecture to provide flexibility and high availability
        \item targets decentralized cloud architectures
      \end{itemize}
    \item \cite{ToffettiMicroservices}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item architecture-based approach
        \item self-managing microservice applications
        \item within application
        \item targets microservice applications
      \end{itemize}
    \item \cite{DashofyArchitecture}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item architecture-based approach
        \item $\rightarrow$ repairs are done on the level of software components or connectors
        \item external to application
        \item targets event-based software architectures
      \end{itemize}
    \item This approach
      \begin{itemize}
        \item microservice container orchestrator approach
        \item $\rightarrow$ repairs are done on container-level
        \item external to application (\gls{kubernetes})
        \item targets microservice architectures deployed in cloud environments using containers and \gls{kubernetes}
      \end{itemize}
    \item \cite{gru}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item similar to this approach, but they have developed their own container orchestration tool, called Gru, instead of using \gls{kubernetes}
        \item also targets microservice architectures deployed in containers
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
